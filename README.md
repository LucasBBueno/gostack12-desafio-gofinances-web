## :memo: About

This project was developed during the seventh challenge of GoStack12 - Bootcamp. It consists of an application with ReactJS and TypeScript for listing and importing transactions through the node API that was created in the previous challenge and can be verified [here](https://github.com/LucasBBueno/gostack12-desafio-database-Upload).

We have two main routes, one for listing Transactions and the other for importing. This challenge was important because it was possible to further practice the use of ReactJS with TypeScript, in addition to stylized components with styled-components, as well as requests using Axios.

Thanks to [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/") for proposing this activity.
